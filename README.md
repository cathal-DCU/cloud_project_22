# A project undertaken for the DCU 2021/2022 CA687I Cloud Systems module

This project was undertaken as part of the DCU MSc in Blockchain technologies. We designed an application that can query the Twitter API based on a user's topic of interest. Collected tweet data and visuals are updated live and displayed in the Dash App. We used Google Cloud services as our techology platform.
To get started, please read the getting_started.MD file on how to set up your Google Cloud environment.
